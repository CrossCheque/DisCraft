 -p number_or_name
            Preselect a window. This is usefull when you want to reattach to a
            specific  windor or you want to send a command via the "-X" option
            to a specific window. As with screen's select commant, "-" selects
            the  blank  window.  As a special case for reattach, "=" brings up
            the windowlist on the blank window.

-S sessionname
            When creating a new session, this option can be used to specify  a
            meaningful  name for the session. This name identifies the session
            for "screen -list" and "screen -r"  actions.  It  substitutes  the
            default [tty.host] suffix.

-X   Send the specified command to a running screen  session.  You  can
            use  the  -d or -r option to tell screen to look only for attached
            or detached screen sessions. Note that this command  doesn't  work
            if the session is password protected.

-d -m   
     Start  screen  in  "detached"  mode. This creates a new session but
	    doesn't attach to it. This is useful for system startup scripts.
